To successfully set up the Boot to Qt software stack,
follow the instructions in https://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation/qtdc-qbsp-installation-guide.html#.

In Boundary Devices i.MX6 Board target devices, see also the U-Boot and
Nitrogen6_Lite device specific instructions:


2. Installing QBSP on Host Platform

After you have flashed the device with Flashing Wizard, you may need to update U-Boot:

* If you are updating your Boundary Devices i.MX6 Board from an older image,
update the U-Boot version on the device. See 2.1 Updating U-Boot.
* If your target device is Nitrogen6_Lite Device, see 1.2 Setup for Nitrogen6_Lite Device.

Note: Sometimes U-Boot fails to select a suitable display for your target device
and sets an incorrect display resolution.
https://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation/qtee-customization.html#configuring-display-resolution
instructs how you can configure the display and resolution used in your target device.


2.1 Updating U-Boot

If you are updating from an older image, you may also need to update the version
of U-Boot on the device.

The prebuilt image already contains U-Boot versions for most of the device variants
from Boundary Devices, but the update needs to be done manually when first starting
the device. Correct device type is selected by setting the uboot_defconfig
U-Boot environment variable.

More information available from https://boundarydevices.com/compiling-latest-u-boot-for-i-mx6-2015-edition/.

Access the device's console and run the following commands on the U-Boot prompt:

setenv uboot_defconfig <device type>
setenv devnum 1 # or 0, if using SD slot
setenv devtype mmc
run upgradeu

Reset or power cycle the device to start the new U-Boot. To reset the U-Boot
environment to new default values, enter the following commands in the U-Boot
command line:

env default -a
saveenv


2.2 Setup for Nitrogen6_Lite Device

The boot script requires the environment variables, dtbname and gpumem, to identify
the device as Nitrogen6_Lite. Otherwise, the device is booted with the default
GPU memory setting of 512MiB, which is more than what is available on the
Nitrogen_Lite devices (128MibB).

Use one of the two following options to enable the scripts boot the device with
correct GPU memory setting:

* Write a uEnv.txt file on to the boot partition of SD card with the following content:

gpumem=67108864
dtbname=imx6dl-nit6xlite.dtb

* Access the device's console and run the following commands on the U-Boot prompt:

U-Boot > setenv gpumem 67108864
U-Boot > setenv dtbname imx6dl-nit6xlite.dtb
U-Boot > saveenv
